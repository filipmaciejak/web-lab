    <h1>The Five Pillars of Islam</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="special-border">
            <h2>Faith</h2>
            <span>
                The belief that "There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the Messenger of God" is central to Islam. This phrase, written in Arabic, is often prominently featured in architecture and a range of objects, including the Qur'an, Islam's holy book of divine revelations.

        </div>
        <div class="special-border">
            <h2>Prayer</h2>
            <span>
                Muslims pray facing Mecca five times a day: at dawn, noon, mid-afternoon, sunset, and after dark. Prayer includes a recitation of the opening chapter (sura) of the Qur'an, and is sometimes performed on a small rug or mat used expressly for this purpose.
            </span>
        </div>
        <div class="special-border">
            <h2>Almsgiving</h2>
            <span>
                In accordance with Islamic law, Muslims donate a fixed portion of their income to community members in need. Many rulers and wealthy Muslims build mosques, drinking fountains, hospitals, schools, and other institutions both as a religious duty and to secure the blessings associated with charity.
            </span>
        </div>
        <div class="special-border">
            <h2>Fasting</h2>
            <span>
                During the daylight hours of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, all healthy adult Muslims are required to abstain from food and drink. Through this temporary deprivation, they renew their awareness of and gratitude for everything God has provided in their lives—including the Qur'an, which was first revealed during this month.
            </span>
        </div>
        <div class="special-border">
            <h2>Pilgrimage</h2>
            <span>
                Every Muslim whose health and finances permit it must make at least one visit to the holy city of Mecca, in present-day Saudi Arabia. The Ka'ba, a cubical structure covered in black embroidered hangings, is at the center of the Haram Mosque in Mecca. Muslims believe that it is the house Abraham built for God, and face in its direction when they pray.
